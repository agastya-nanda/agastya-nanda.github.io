			<br /> <br />      This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all software

			This is where the bloodthirsty license agreement is supposed to go,
			explaining that Interactive Easyflow is a copyrighted package licensed for use by a single person, and sternly warning you not to pirate copies of it and explaining, in detail, the gory consequences if you do.
			<br />  <br />We know that you are an honest person, and are not going to go around pirating copies of Interactive Easyflow; this is just as well with us since we worked hard to perfect it and selling copies of it is our only method of making anything out of all the hard work.
			<br />  <br />If, on the other hand, you are one of those few people who do go around pirating copies of software you probably aren't going to pay much attention to a license agreement, bloodthirsty or not.  Just keep your doors locked and look out for the HavenTree attack shark.

...very few phenomena can pull someone out of Deep Hack Mode, with two

If it happens, it must be possible.

To err is human -- but it feels divine.

In order to discover who you are, first learn who everybody else is;
you're what's left.

The history of warfare is similarly subdivided, although here the phases
are Retribution, Anticipation, and Diplomacy.  Thus:

Retribution:
		I'm going to kill you because you killed my brother.
Anticipation:
	I'm going to kill you because I killed your brother.
Diplomacy:
	I'm going to kill my brother and then kill you on the
	pretext that your brother did it.

God made everything out of nothing, but the nothingness shows through.

It was one of those perfect summer days -- the sun was shining, a breeze

Get forgiveness now -- tomorrow you may no longer feel guilty.

		"We're running out of adjectives to describe our situation.  We

Nicaraguan economist Francisco Mayorga, who holds a doctorate from Yale.

The New Yorker's comment:
